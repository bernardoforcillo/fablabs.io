      answer-1: In order to be listed on FabLabs.io, you have to fill the form below
        and discuss your ne Lab with 3 Referee Labs that you can choose in the form.
        Please fill the details of the form below and choose 3 of the Referee Labs
        available and contact them, they will approve you after you have exchanged
        more information with them. The list of Referee Labs is limited to some Fab
        Labs with experience and a history of collaborating with the global Fab Lab
        Network, at the moment it is not possible to choose Referee Labs outside that
        list. It's not important that you already know them, it's important that you
        start a discussion with them. We are doing this so that the connections among
        the Labs (especially for new Labs) get strengthened.
      answer-2: Referee Labs might be busy, so it depends also on their time. Please
        do not forget that being listed on FabLabs.io is not the only thing that makes
        your lab a Fab Lab, you need to interact with the global Fab Lab network continuously
        and not only when creating the application.
      answer-3: For the moment the process is simple, the important thing is to get
        in contact with the 3 Referee Labs you choose.
      answer-4: You can ask for support to the administrators and the whole community
        in the Fablabs.io forum section. As soon as you create the application of
        a Fab Lab here, a new thread about your Lab will be created in the forum.
      answer-5: If you have technical issues, you can report them on GitHub.
      faq: F.A.Q
      item-1: We have recently redesigned the Fab Lab approval process to minimise
        the waiting time for Labs to get approved.
      item-2: Each new Lab need to go through the referee approval process in order
        to get approved on the platform.
      item-3: Each Lab, need to select three Referee Labs during the application process.
        These are trusted Labs on our platform. Please note that you can, but you
        do not have to necessarily select, labs close to you geographically.
      item-4: Referees might request more info about your Lab. In this case you will
        receive an email inviting you to add more content to some sections of the
        Lab form.
      item-5: Referees can also send a Lab for admin approval. In this case, it will
        be up to the platform admins to approve or not the new Lab.
      item-6: When submitted, is first assigned the "unverified" state. If one of
        the referee gives their first approval the Lab is moved into the "referee
        approval" state.
      item-7: If the Referee rejects, the Lab is moved to the "might need review"
        state. Being in one of the two states doesn't guarantee approval, nor means
        that the Lab will be rejected.
      item-8: The Lab will be rejected or approved depending on the vote of the Referees.
      question-1: How does the registration of a new Lab work?
      question-2: What is the average/ rough time-span for an new Lab to achieve the
        status of a "Fab Lab" on the list?
      question-3: Are there multiple stages to complete the registration?
      question-4: What can I do if I have problems with the registration process?
      we_are_in_the_process: We are in the process of improving the list of Fab Labs
        and the approval process, which may change in the future. Before adding a
        Lab sure to read the current approval process guidelines below.

      fab_labs_description: Fab labs provide widespread access to modern means for
        invention. They began as an outreach project from MIT's Center for Bits and
        Atoms (CBA), and became into a collaborative and global network. You can find
        more information about Fab Labs on the <a href='www.fabfoundation.org'>Fab
        Foundation</a> Website. The annotated photo below illustrates the facilities
